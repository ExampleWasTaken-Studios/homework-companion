Bugs are unintended behavior of Homework Companion that diminish a user's experience.


Submitting a bug report according to the guidelines outlined below helps us understand your issue, reproduce it, and eventually fix it.


#### Before Submitting a Report
- Make sure you use the [latest](https://github.com/examplewastaken-studios/homework-companion/releases/latest) version of Homework Companion.
- Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/examplewastaken-studios/homework-companion/issues)


#### Submitting a (Good) Report
- Use a clear and descriptive but short title
- Describe the exact steps to reproduce the issue in as much detail as possible. Don't just list what you did, but *how* you did it.
- Explain what you expect to happen for the steps described above
- Explain what actually happened
- Include as many screenshots, video recordings, etc. as necessary to explain the issue.
- If the issue wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before.
- Provide more context by answering these questions:
- Did the issue start happening recently (after an update?) or was this always a problem?
- Can you reliably reproduce the issue? If not, provide details about how often and under what conditions the issue happens.
