## Platforms

Of if you already have it installed go to `Settings > Check for Updates`.

> For more information on why this is happening see the [FAQ](#faq).

#### Windows

## FAQ
### Why does my OS indicate that this app cannot be verified?
For security reasons Apple and Microsoft introduced a verification step for app developers that ensures the contents of an app are verified by them. The price of around $500 for such a certificate per year makes it impossible for open source developers to aquire it. Therefore our app is not verified.  
The contents of Homework Companion are 100% accessible through this repository.  
Auto updates are directly downloaded from the releases section.
